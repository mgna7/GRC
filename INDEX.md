## 💡 Tips for Success

### Do's

✅ **Start with Auth Service** - It's complete, study it
✅ **Follow the Implementation Guide** - Phase by phase
✅ **Test as you go** - Don't save testing for the end
✅ **Use Docker Compose** - Start local, then Kubernetes
✅ **Read the documentation** - Everything is documented
✅ **Copy patterns** - Auth Service is your template
✅ **Ask questions** - Documentation has all answers

### Don'ts

❌ **Skip Auth Service** - It's your reference implementation
❌ **Implement out of order** - Follow dependency chain
❌ **Skip testing** - You'll regret it later
❌ **Ignore security** - It's built in, keep it
❌ **Skip documentation** - Future you will thank you
❌ **Reinvent patterns** - Use what's provided
❌ **Deploy without testing** - Test locally first
