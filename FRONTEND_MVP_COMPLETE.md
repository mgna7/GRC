2. API creates user account in database
3. You receive JWT token
4. Automatically logged in and redirected to dashboard

### **Add ServiceNow Instance:**
1. Form validates URL format (must be *.service-now.com)
2. Test connection verifies credentials
3. Instance saved to database
4. Appears in instance list

### **Run Analysis:**
1. Analysis job created in database
2. Celery worker picks up the task
3. Data fetched from ServiceNow
4. AI processes the data
5. Results stored in database
6. You can view the results

### **Sync Data:**
1. Triggers data pull from ServiceNow
2. Updates GRC assets, risks, controls in database
3. Updates "last_sync" timestamp
4. Shows success/error message

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Frontend not loading?**
```bash
# Restart frontend
docker-compose -f docker-compose.microservices.yml restart frontend

# Check logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.microservices.yml logs frontend
```

### **Can't login?**
1. Make sure backend services are running:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.microservices.yml ps
   ```
2. Check if API gateway (Kong) is running on port 9000
3. Try registering a new account first

### **API errors?**
1. Check backend logs:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.microservices.yml logs auth-service
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.microservices.yml logs api-gateway
   ```
2. Verify services are healthy:
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

## 🔐 Security Notes

- Passwords are hashed in the backend
- JWT tokens expire after 24 hours
- Credentials are encrypted in database
- All API calls require authentication
- Protected routes redirect to login
