## 🚀 How to Start Implementing

### Step 1: Set Up Development Environment

1. Install Python 3.11+
2. Install Docker Desktop
3. Install Node.js 18+ (for frontend)
4. Clone the repository

### Step 2: Test Auth Service

```bash
# Copy environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your passwords and keys

# Start only infrastructure + auth service
docker-compose -f docker-compose.microservices.yml up -d \
  postgres-auth \
  redis \
  auth-service

# Test the API
curl http://localhost:8001/health

# View API docs
# Open: http://localhost:8001/docs
```

### Step 3: Implement Services One by One

**Recommended order:**

1. **User Service** (depends on Auth)
   - Copy `services/auth/` to `services/user/`
   - Modify models, schemas, and routes
   - Test with Auth Service

2. **Organization Service** (depends on Auth, User)
   - Copy service template
   - Add Stripe integration
   - Test subscription management

3. **Instance Service** (depends on Organization)
   - Migrate existing code
   - Add multi-tenant support
   - Test ServiceNow connection

4. **Analysis Service** (depends on Instance)
   - Migrate analysis engines
   - Add Celery workers
   - Test async processing

5. Continue with remaining services...

### Step 4: Implement Frontend

```bash
cd services/frontend

# Create React app with TypeScript
npx create-react-app . --template typescript

# Install dependencies
npm install axios react-router-dom @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux recharts

# Install Tailwind CSS
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p

# Start development
npm start
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
Each service should have 80%+ code coverage:
```bash
cd services/auth
pytest tests/ --cov=app --cov-report=html
```

### Integration Tests
Test service-to-service communication:
```python
# tests/integration/test_auth_user_flow.py
def test_user_registration_creates_profile():
    # 1. Register via Auth Service
    response = auth_api.register(...)

    # 2. Verify user exists in User Service
    user = user_api.get_user(user_id)
    assert user.email == "test@example.com"
```

### End-to-End Tests
Use Playwright or Cypress for frontend tests:
```javascript
test('user can register and login', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('http://localhost:3000/register');
  await page.fill('[name="email"]', 'test@example.com');
  await page.fill('[name="password"]', 'SecurePass123!');
  await page.click('button[type="submit"]');
  await expect(page).toHaveURL('/dashboard');
});
```

### Load Tests
Use k6 or Locust:
```javascript
// load-test.js
export let options = {
  stages: [
    { duration: '2m', target: 100 },
    { duration: '5m', target: 100 },
    { duration: '2m', target: 0 },
  ],
};
```

## 💡 Key Decisions Made

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Microservices over Monolith**: For scalability, maintainability, and team autonomy
2. **API Gateway (Kong)**: Centralized routing, rate limiting, and authentication
3. **JWT Tokens**: Stateless authentication across services
4. **Multi-Tenancy**: Shared database with `organization_id` isolation
5. **Event-Driven**: RabbitMQ for async communication
6. **Docker First**: Containerized for consistency across environments

### Technology Choices
1. **FastAPI**: Modern, fast, with automatic API docs
2. **PostgreSQL**: Robust, ACID-compliant, JSON support
3. **Redis**: Fast caching and session storage
4. **React + TypeScript**: Type-safe, component-based UI
5. **Kubernetes**: Industry-standard orchestration

### Security Decisions
1. **bcrypt for passwords**: Industry standard
2. **AES-256 for credentials**: Strong encryption
3. **JWT RS256**: Asymmetric signing for production
4. **Row-level security**: Database-level tenant isolation
5. **Rate limiting**: Kong plugin per tenant

## 🆘 Getting Help

If you need help implementing any service:

1. **Reference the Auth Service**: It's a complete working example
2. **Check the Implementation Guide**: Step-by-step instructions
3. **Review the Architecture Document**: Understand the design
4. **Look at Docker Compose**: See how services connect
5. **Read the API Documentation**: Each service has `/docs`

2. **Test the Auth Service** to understand the pattern
3. **Implement User Service** next (highest priority)
4. **Set up CI/CD** early for automated testing
5. **Implement services in order** following the dependencies
6. **Write tests as you go** (don't save for the end)
7. **Deploy to staging** after each service is complete
8. **Build frontend incrementally** as backend APIs are ready
